For the  example given:  -rw-r--r-- 1 userhacsa userhacsa 70 Oct 14 10:00 script.sh

The first symbol, "-" indicates that it is a regular file

The next 3 characters, "rw-" are the file permissions of the owner of the file
If a user has 100% percent access to a file it would be "rwx"
This means they have Read, Write and Execute permissions.

In this case, the owner has read and write permission represented by the "r" and "w" respectively
The "-" symbol means they don't have execute permission on that file.

The same thing apply to the other 2 user groups, "group" and "others"
In this case both the "group" and "others" have only read permission to the file 
and cannot write into the file or execute the file.

The character "1" means that the file "script.sh" has only one directory entry

"userhacsa" is the owner of the file
The second "userhacsa" is the group associated to the file

The character "70" is the size of the file in bytes

"Oct 14 10:00" is the date and time the file was last changed or modified

"script.sh" is the name of the file
