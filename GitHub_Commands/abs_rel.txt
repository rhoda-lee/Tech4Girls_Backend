Absolute paths are used when you are far from the directory you want to go into but still go into it.
This means that the directory you are accessing is not a direct child of the parent directory or the directory you are currently in.
	eg: cd rhodalee/Tech4Girls_Backend/GitHub_Commands
    
Relative paths are used to specify the location of a file or directory relative to the parent directory.
This happens by moving from a parent directory to its direct child directory after the other 
until you reach your destinated directory
	eg: cd Tech4Girls_Backend
