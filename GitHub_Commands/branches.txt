The git pull command is used to pull new changes or commits from our remote repository or GitHub to our local repository on our local computer.
It allows us to update our local repository by fetching any changes and integrating them into our local branch.

The git command is useful to me when collaborating with others since I will pull any changes collaborators will make to my local computer to avoid conflicts.
I also use the command to bring my local branch up-to date with the remote branch.
