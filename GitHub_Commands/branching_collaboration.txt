Branching is a feature that allows developers to collaboratively work on a project at the same time 
without interfering with eachothers code or contribution.
It also helps reduce conflicts that could arise from working directly in the main branch.

Each collaborator creates a branch and works within it
They then open a pull request which if it has no conflicts will be merged into th main branch so they are up-to date.
