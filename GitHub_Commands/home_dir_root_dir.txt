The root directory is the topmost directory in the Linux file system. 
It contains all other directories like the "home", "usr", "bin", "temp", "etc" directory among others.
It is also the strting point of the entire file system.

The home directory on the other hand is a subdirectory of the root directory.
This means that the home directory can be found inside the root directory.
It contains individual directories for each user account on the system.
