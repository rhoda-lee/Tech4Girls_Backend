File ownership in Linux system determines who owns a file.
A user can be the owner, part of a group or just another user on the system

The file modes determine the access level a user has to a file whether read , write or execute permissions
Users with read permission can only view or read a file
Users with write permissions can make changes to a file
Users with execute permissions can run the file a sa program
A user can have one, two, all or none of these permissions to  file

Permissions are applied to every group, where:
o - owner
g - group
u - user
The permission are either represented by a string of characters 'rwx' where:
r - read
w - write
x - execute
and a hyphen '-' is placed where the user does not have permission
So in a case where the owner has all permission and both group and others have only read permissions will be like:
-rwxr--r--, This can be displayed using the ls -l linux command

The other way they are represented is using the nodes which are represented by numbers
The nodes are used to represent permissions
4 represents read
2 represents write
1 represents execute
The owner permission is represented by 7 ie; 4 + 2 + 1
