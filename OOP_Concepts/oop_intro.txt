What is object oriented programming?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs in classes which represents a real world model of almost anything.
It could be a representation of a person, a place, animal or some inanimate object.
OOP makes use of objects that are instances of a real world object.
Classes and objects in OOP have attributes (features) and methods(functionality of actions they can perform)

For instance, let's say we have a class called 'Human', it is typical every Human has some attributes like
a name, age and height. Also Humans can eat, sleep and drink.
In this class, the attribute are the name, age and height and the methods are to eat(), sleep() and drink()

We can also create objects or instances of the class.
We are all Humans in general but we have our individual differences.
With OOP we can easily model that and have instances for each unique person where if they have specific feature and methods
unique to them, we can add it.

There are four main principles in Object Oriented Programming
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Encapsulation
Encapsulation is concerned with putting attributes and methods into classes.
Like a capsule contains items. The concept of encapsulation is putting related functions and 
features inside of designated classes. This restricts direct access to the attributes and methods of
a particular class.
Hence, it groups related methods and attributws into classes
In our Human slass example, the class encapsulates data(attributes and methods) such as name, age, sleep() and eat()


''' We model our Human class'''
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
    
     def sleep(self):
        return f'{self.name} is sleeping!'

    def eat(self):
        return f'{self.name} is eating!'

    def drink(self):
        return f'{self.name} is drinking!'





Abstraction
Abstraction is a way of writing programs such that, 
we hide the complicated details of an application and only show the needed aspects.
An abstract method in pyhton is a method that is declared in a parent class but has not been implemented.
This method can then be used in child classes where we pass implementation necessary to that class only.
Let's use our Human class as an example


''' We model our Human class'''
class Human:
    def __init__(self, name, age, height):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.height = height
    
    @abstractclass
    def sleep(self):
        pass

    @abstractclass
    def eat(self):
        pass

    @abstractclass
    def drink(self):
        pass


'''Create a class Woman that inherits from the Human class'''
class Woman(Human):
    def __init(self, name, age, height, gender = Female):
        super().__init__(name, age, height):
        self.gender = gender

    #Incluse implementation for the abstract classes

    def sleep(self):
        return f'{self.name} is sleeping!'

    def eat(self):
        return f'{self.name} is eating!'

    def drink(self):
        return f'{self.name} is drinking!'


'''From the example above, we can say that Human is an abstract class.
It served as a template for the Woman class without having any complex implementation inside of it
We did the implementation necessary to the Woman class inside of it, using the Human class as reference
This explains the concept of Abstraction'''



Inheritance
The concept of inheritance is the idea of passing down the features a nd functions of a class to another class.
just like a parent passes down their features and some abilities to their children,
so dos classes in OOP.
The class that inherits the attributes and methods from the parent class is the Child or Subclass
The class that passes down the attributes and methods to another class is the Parent or Superclass

Let us use a class called Car to explain the concept of Inheritance

'''Modeling th parent class'''
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        '''Method to display car information'''
        return f'The {self.make} {self.model} was released in the year {self.year}'


'''Create a subclass to inherit the Car class'''
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.color = color

    def display_info(self):
        '''Method to display car information'''
        return f'The {self.color} {self.make} {self.model} was released in the year {self.year}'

'''The ElectricCar class inherits from the car class. 
The super() method is used to initialize the instance variables 
from the Car class so the ElectricCar class can use it.
This explains the concept of inheritance'''


Polymorphism
In programming, Polymorphism refers to the ability of different objects 
to respond to the same method call in different ways.
This means that one method call can take different forms depending on how they are called
on a particular subclass.
Let us use a Superclass Animal as an example:

'''Modeling a class, Animal'''
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass # method will be implemented in child classes

# First subclass
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Second subclass
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

# Third subclass
class Cow(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Moo!"

def make_animal_speak(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

# Creating instances
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Ginger")
cow = Cow("Mullan")

# Using the function
make_animal_speak(dog)  # Buddy says Woof!
make_animal_speak(cat)  # Ginger says Meow!
make_animal_speak(cow)  # Mullan says Moo!


Object Oriented Programming is beneficial in software development in many ways, some of which are;

Code reusability
Inheritance in OOP helps to reuse code that belonged to one class 
inside of another class without repeating the code for that functionality.

Encapsulation
The concept of Encapsulation in OOP allows developers to group related methods and attributes into classes
This improves readability of our code

Code Maintainace
writing code using OOP makes it easy to maintain the code base since there is consistency in the code

The previous examples used to explain the four main principles of OOP,
site real world scenarios of the use of OOP
Typically a human would have a name, age and height
OOP allows us to model this real-world instance using classes and 
even create instances of the class using methods
